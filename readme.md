**Copyright:** Â© 2024 Krish. All rights reserved.

## Overview

**Lumina** is a Python-based project that leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL) for portfolio management. By integrating market data analysis, Hidden Markov Models (HMM), and a custom RL environment built with Gymnasium, this project trains and evaluates a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent to optimize portfolio performance.

## Features

1. **Market Regime Detection**: Utilizes Hidden Markov Models to identify market regimes based on historical returns.
2. **Reinforcement Learning Environment**: Custom Gymnasium environment tailored for portfolio management.
3. **Technical Indicators**: Includes moving averages and volatility for enhanced state representation.
4. **PPO Agent Training**: Trains a PPO model on a realistic simulation of market conditions.
5. **Backtesting**: Evaluates the trained strategy using historical data.
6. **Metrics**: Computes key metrics such as Sharpe Ratio and Maximum Drawdown.
